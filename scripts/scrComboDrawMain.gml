/* MAIN STRUCTURE
For the door itself, even though i might create Multicolor spending someday (or not),
there is a w, h, and the colorSpend variable, as well as a col 1-D array to store colors.
We have a 2D array of locks, in the form [Index,Attribute].
Pre-included is 3 (x), 4 (y), and 5 (sprite).

The main draw order is: [Fills] -> [Frame] -> [Locks -> Auras] -> [Invert FX -> Copy Text].
The brackets designate groups which can be switched on/off depending on certain variables.
Fills includes those of locks, since all locks should be contained in the frame.
*/

/*PARTS I HAVE COMPLETED SO FAR:
Main Fill + Lock Fills
Frame
Lock Sprites/Symbols
NEXT UP: Auras... can be skipped actually. I wanna visually change them to have shaders
ACTUAL NEXT UP: Invert FX + Copy Text oh it's done*/
