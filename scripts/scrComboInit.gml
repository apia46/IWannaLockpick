///These are a whole lot more complex than the Simple doors...
/*BASIC STRUCTURE:
There is an array of locks.
Each lock has 6 variables: Color, Count, Type, X/Y Offset, and Sprite.
Type overrides Count in some cases, but a distinction is still needed.
As for the door itself, there's Color Spend, w, h, Auras 0-2, Browned, and Copies.
ALSO Present is a Lock Counter, which is initially empty. This means you can open the door
no matter what, but this shouldn't really ever be the case. Ingame it'd look like a blank.
For Drawing, theres Gold Index/Spd, but also a 2D array of colors for each lock.
Locks will be added in Creation Code using a special script.
