# I Wanna Lockpick
I Wanna Lockpick's source code.<br>
You can find the game at https://lawatson.itch.io/i-wanna-lockpick<br>
I did not make the game; project files were provided by LAWatson.<br>
Based on an outdated version (seemingly 4/27/24); noticed changes since then have been added.<br>
Use GameMaker Studio 1.4.x<br>
For modding, forking the refactored branch instead of the main is recommended
